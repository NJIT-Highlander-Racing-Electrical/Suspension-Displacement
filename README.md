# Suspension Displacement

Displacement sensors on each shock would enable us to determine how much each shock is being compressed while driving the car.

## Goals

* Determine what type of sensor is best to determine displacement
* Determine most afforable option
* Four sensors is ideal, but if the cost is too high, two sensors would be the bare minimum

## Specs

* Should be able to operate at 3.3V or 5V
* Output voltage should work at 3.3V (or we can use a logic level shifter/resistive divider)

* Shock is 8" fully compressed and 16" fully extended
* So, sensor need to be able to have at least 8" of travel
