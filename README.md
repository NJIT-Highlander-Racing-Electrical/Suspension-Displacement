# Suspension Displacement

Displacement sensors on each shock would enable us to determine how much each shock is being compressed while driving the car.
This system will be wired into the [Wheel Speed Sensors](https://github.com/NJIT-Highlander-Racing-Electrical/Wheel-Speed-Sensors) for data processing, so for code and 3D files, check there.

## Hardware

Linear sensors that give an output voltage proportional to their displacement

## Specs

* Should be able to operate at 3.3V or 5V
* Output voltage should work at 3.3V (or we can use a logic level shifter/resistive divider)

* Shock is 8" fully compressed and 16" fully extended
* So, sensor need to be able to have at least 8" of travel
* Or, we need to have a way to reduce the travel to a smaller sensing range
