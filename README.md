# Suspension Displacement

Displacement sensors on each shock would enable us to determine how much each shock is being compressed while driving the car.

## Goals

* Determine what type of sensor is best to determine dislpacement
* Determine most afforable option
* Four sensors is ideal, but if the cost is too high, but two sensors would be the bare minimum
